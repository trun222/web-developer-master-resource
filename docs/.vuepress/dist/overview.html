These companying resources will help grow and suppliment any
current knowledge you may have about HTML and any new specs and improvements to the standard.</p> <h3 id="css3-and-beyond"><a href="#css3-and-beyond" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> CSS3 and Beyond</h3> <p>CSS is what has made websites pretty. There are tons of pre-processors and fun innovations that have
occured in tooling for css in the past few years in order to make it more accessible and maintainable to
web developers. There will be resources for different pre-processors, the CSS spec it's self as well as
blogs and other websites that stay current about CSS and where it is going.</p> <h3 id="javascript-es5-es2019"><a href="#javascript-es5-es2019" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Javascript (ES5 -&gt; ES2019)</h3> <p>Javascript has really lead the rennesaince when it comes to innovation and workflow in the modern web.
There are countless improvements to make javascript more accessible and easier to use by there being
many new javascript frameworks to stream line a once fragmented javascript ecosystem on the web.
There will be resources for the current and future javascript (ECMA) standards as well as blogs,
documentation, and other resources that expose you to more of the javascript ecosystem.</p> <h2 id="js-frameworks"><a href="#js-frameworks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> JS Frameworks</h2> <h3 id="vue"><a href="#vue" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Vue</h3> <p>Vue is one of the new kids on the block. It has been around for only about 2 years and came from Evan You who for a
while has been the soul maintainer and creator of Vue. He was a Google employee who was interested in created a modern
javascript framework that solved many of the issues of prior frameworks. Vue is a mixture of many of the features and
concepts from React and Angular with a few new features and ideas of their own. They have really simplified developing
single page applications while giving developers a rich feature set and still supplying a small bundle payload.</p> <h3 id="react"><a href="#react" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> React</h3> <p>React is the baby of Facebook. It was initially used for many of their internal projects in order to remove some of the
reliance on php and other antiquated web technologies in favor of a javascript based platform. Facebook redid Messenger
and several other main parts of Facebook and other websites that they own with React. Instagram was also re-written
with React Native (Mobile). This shows how impactful javascript and JS frameworks have been and how widely used they
are by large organizations in order to deliver content to many users. React is one of the best and most widely used
javascript frameworks for making modular and high-performant web applications while maintaining an excellent developer
experience.</p> <h3 id="angular"><a href="#angular" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Angular</h3> <p>Angular was the first major kid on the block when it comes to javascript frameworks. Many of the modern web development
and framework paradigms were first put into a production ready framework from the Angular team that was founded from Google.
Angular brought the idea of modular 'component' based design to the web by allowing developers to easy organize and structure
their web applications based on a collection of components that form pages, instead of thinking of sites in terms of just pages.
The popularity of Angular has been waining the past few years as their development cycle and fragmented releases have alienated
many early adopters of the framework as well as other javascript frameworks out innovating and focusing more on improving the
overall general javascript developer experience.</p> <h2 id="ui-frameworks"><a href="#ui-frameworks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> UI Frameworks</h2> <p>UI Frameworks have helped web developers focus less on the design of components and more on how a web application should function.
Their general purpose is to relieve some of the burden of styling a web application, as well as empowering users to build fluid
and responsive single page web applications that work well on many types of displays as well as having modern and visually appealing
designs. These frameworks often cover base functionality that is require from such UI components such as search capabilities, caching,
changing colors and other attributes for a given component. The functionalty for components is often changeable through props which are
passed down from parent components. This allows a generic component to become more customizable for a particular usecase without requiring
the web developer to implement common base functionalty and is necessary for every web application.</p> <h2 id="bootstrap"><a href="#bootstrap" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bootstrap</h2> <p>Bootstrap was created by Twitter to be a responsive, mobile-first UI framework. It is really useful for rapidly protyping UI layouts. As well as
creating consistent, responsive, and pleasant user experiences across any web applications. It is easy to use and covers most usecases that users have.
It also provides helper utitlities and a well thoughtout CSS grid system and flexbox implementation that makes laying out user interfaces trivial.</p> <h2 id="material-design-lite-mdl"><a href="#material-design-lite-mdl" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Material Design Lite (MDL)</h2> <p>Material Design Lite was created by Google that allows users to add a Material Design look and feel to their websites. MDL was designed to be mobile first
and follows the design principles around a 'flat' or 'material' design. There was extensive design and research put into this system that Google utilizes
in many of it's child products. The MDL framework allows developers to create consistent, beautiful UI's that are intuitive and responsive for any device.
This project is ever growing and we are expecting MDL 2 to be coming out soon which will iterate on the successes of MDL and improve some flaws.</p> <h2 id="package-managers"><a href="#package-managers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Package Managers</h2> <p>Package managers as the name gives away are what is used to download and provision dependencies that are used in modern web
development. They also keep track of the currently install packages as well as the versioning for each package. Package managers
are one of the major reasons that the web development space has taken off as it has with the ease of installing and maintaining packages
and versioning.</p> <h3 id="npm"><a href="#npm" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> NPM</h3> <p>NPM is the native package manager for node. The npm registry boasts the world's largest software registry. NPM is what is used to install
packages and dependencies for a given project. It's package.json file is what is used to track packages and their currently installed versions.
The package.json is also used to store development and deployment alias' for tasks so that they are easily accessible for developers.</p> <h3 id="yarn"><a href="#yarn" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Yarn</h3> <p>Facebook developed Yarn in order to iterate on and improve npm's short comings such as caching packages, parallel dependency installs and verifying check
sums before installs. It is still the new kid on the block, but it's registry and community support has been growing. With that said new versions of npm
have tried to fix some of the underlying issues with their package manager.</p> <h2 id="tooling"><a href="#tooling" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tooling</h2> <p>Tooling for the modern web has changed at a break neck pace. Every 2 years there is a new mover and shaker
who has fixed the previous generations glaring flaws while often times introducing new issues and pain points.
In this section we will cover some of the main tools that are crucial to modern web development.</p> <h3 id="webpack"><a href="#webpack" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Webpack</h3> <p>Webpack is a dependency bundler and injector for web development assets. It's output is traditionally a single javascript bundle. It has been a revolutionary
tool as it has allowed developers to use whatever prepressors and plugins they want with minimal involvement after initial setup. Webpack has
also brought in many cool development productivity tools such as hot module replacement (HMR). Webpack's feature set is easily extensible
through it's growing plugin system.</p> <h3 id="babel"><a href="#babel" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Babel</h3> <p>Babel is javascript compiler that is often used in conjunction with webpack in order to allow new and proposed javascript functionality to be used before the (ECMA) standard is finalized. It is also used to poly-fill and support legacy browsers (IE), and to allow support for typescript and other javascript variants.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
